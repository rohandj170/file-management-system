# file-management-system
A simple and efficient file management web application built using Node.js and Express.js.

💾 Local File Storage – Files are stored securely on the server’s filesystem.

⚙️ Express Backend – Handles file requests efficiently with RESTful routes.

🧭 Clean UI – Simple and responsive interface for smooth navigation.
