# file-management-system
A simple and efficient file management web application built using Node.js and Express.js. This project allows users to upload, view, download, and delete files directly from the web interface — acting as a personal file storage system similar to Google Drive, but running entirely on your own server.

🗂️ Upload & Manage Files – Easily upload, list, download, and delete files.
💾 Local File Storage – Files are stored securely on the server’s filesystem.
⚙️ Express Backend – Handles file requests efficiently with RESTful routes.
🧭 Clean UI – Simple and responsive interface for smooth navigation.
🛠️ Error Handling – Prevents invalid uploads and manages missing files gracefully.
