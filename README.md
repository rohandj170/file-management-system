# file-management-system
A simple and efficient file management web application built using Node.js and Express.js. This project allows users to upload, view, download, and delete files directly from the web interface — acting as a personal file storage system similar to Google Drive, but running entirely on your own server.

# Features
🗂️ Upload & Manage Files – Easily upload, list, download, and delete files.

💾 Local File Storage – Files are stored securely on the server’s filesystem.

⚙️ Express Backend – Handles file requests efficiently with RESTful routes.

🧭 Clean UI – Simple and responsive interface for smooth navigation.

🛠️ Error Handling – Prevents invalid uploads and manages missing files gracefully.

# Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or EJS templates)

File Handling: Multer (for file uploads)

Database (optional): JSON or local storage for metadata

# How It Works

User uploads a file via the web interface.

The server (Node.js + Express) processes and stores it in a local directory.

The dashboard lists all available files.

Users can download or delete files as needed.

# Why This Project?

This project demonstrates backend development, file handling, and server-side logic using Node.js and Express.js.
It’s a great example of how to build a custom local file storage solution with full control over your data and structure — ideal for learning backend and web app development.

# Future Improvements

Add user authentication (login/signup)

Implement folder creation & search

Add file preview support (images, PDFs)

Store metadata in a database (MongoDB, MySQL)
